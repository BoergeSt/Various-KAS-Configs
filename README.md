# Various KAS Configs

**A collection of `kas` configuration files for building Yocto-based systems**

This repository contains `kas` YAML configurations that I personally find useful when working with Yocto.

These configurations are intended as examples and starting points. Most should work out of the box.  
However, some may require out-of-tree layers or private files not included in this repository to build successfully.

## Usage

To use any of the configurations, install [`kas`](https://github.com/siemens/kas) and run:

```sh
kas build path/to/config.yml
```
